# To-do

Some exercises leave me wondering about certain stuff, wanna comeback to them later and won't remember to do so otherwise.

## Change

Take a deeper dive into Dynamic Programming examples, my Algorithms classes are no longer so fresh.

## Poker

Re-do later on, both with a functional, almost code-golfing approach and with a fully oriented class approach.
